# Bronze Tier — Implementation Plan

> Living document. Check off items as they are completed.
> Claude updates this file after each session.

---

## Phase 1 — Vault Foundation ✅

- [x] Create vault folder structure (`Inbox/`, `Needs_Action/`, `Done/`)
- [x] Create `Dashboard.md` with real-time summary template
- [x] Create `Company_Handbook.md` with Rules of Engagement
- [x] Add `Pending_Approval/` folder for human-in-the-loop items

---

## Phase 2 — Watcher (Perception Layer) ✅

- [x] Create `base_watcher.py` — abstract base class with graceful shutdown
- [x] Create `gmail_watcher.py` — Gmail API OAuth2 integration
- [x] Add state persistence (`.gmail_watcher_state.json`) — survives restarts
- [x] Add priority detection (urgent keyword scanning)
- [x] Configure `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies (`google-auth`, `watchdog`)
- [x] Fix `uv sync` build error (`[tool.uv] package = false`)
- [x] Complete Google Cloud Console OAuth setup
- [x] Watcher running live — capturing emails to `Needs_Action/`

---

## Phase 3 — Agent Skills (Reasoning Layer) ✅

- [x] Create `skills/SKILL_Gmail_Triage.md` — email classification + draft replies
- [x] Create `skills/SKILL_Process_Needs_Action.md` — core queue processing loop
- [x] First live integration test — 2 emails triaged, processed, archived to `Done/`
- [x] `Dashboard.md` updated after processing cycle
- [x] `Plan.md` created (this file)

---

## Phase 4 — Claude Integration (Remaining Bronze) 🔲

- [ ] Create `CLAUDE.md` at vault root — operating instructions for Claude Code
  - Tells Claude: read Company_Handbook first, use skills from `skills/`, update Dashboard after every action
  - Defines vault paths, folder purposes, file naming conventions
- [ ] Add `filesystem_watcher.py` — monitors a drop folder for local file processing
  - Implement `DropFolderHandler` from `watcher.md` template
  - Create `/DropZone` folder as the monitored directory
- [ ] Create `SKILL_Update_Dashboard.md` — dedicated skill for Dashboard maintenance
- [ ] Create `SKILL_Daily_Summary.md` — morning briefing generation skill

---

## Phase 5 — Autonomy (Optional Bronze+) 🔲

- [ ] Create `.claude/hooks/stop.py` — Ralph Wiggum stop hook
  - Intercepts Claude exit, checks if task file is in `/Done`
  - Loops until completion or max iterations reached
- [ ] Test Ralph Wiggum loop with a multi-step task
- [ ] Document loop behaviour in `README.md`

---

## Phase 6 — Hardening & Docs 🔲

- [ ] Update `README.md` with full setup guide (vault, watcher, skills, CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` entries for any remaining sensitive files
- [ ] Final Bronze tier checklist review against hackathon requirements:
  - [ ] Obsidian vault with `Dashboard.md` and `Company_Handbook.md` ✅
  - [ ] One working Watcher script ✅
  - [ ] Claude reading from and writing to vault ✅
  - [ ] Basic folder structure: `/Inbox`, `/Needs_Action`, `/Done` ✅
  - [ ] All AI functionality as Agent Skills ✅ (Phase 3)
  - [ ] `CLAUDE.md` present 🔲 (Phase 4)

## Discovered Issues / Notes

| Date       | Issue / Note                                              | Status     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 2026-02-24 | `uv sync` failed — hatchling expecting package dir       | ✅ Fixed   |
| 2026-02-24 | Google OAuth: test user not added → 403 access_denied    | ✅ Fixed   |
| 2026-02-24 | `file_cache` warning from `googleapiclient` (cosmetic)   | ⚪ Ignored |
| 2026-02-24 | Both live emails were self-sent — real external emails not yet tested | 🔲 Monitor |

---

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Create `CLAUDE.md`** — this is the last required Bronze file. Tells Claude how to behave in this vault when invoked from the terminal.
2. **Create `filesystem_watcher.py`** — completes the watcher layer with local file drop support.
3. **Test with a real external email** — send an email from a different account to verify triage handles external senders correctly.
