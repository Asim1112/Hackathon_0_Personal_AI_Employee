## Draft Email Body

Hi,

Thank you for reaching out — it's great to hear you're interested in AI consulting services.

I'd be happy to schedule a 30-minute call to explore how we might work together. I work with businesses looking to implement practical AI solutions — from automating communication workflows to building custom AI tooling that fits your operations.

Could you let me know a couple of times that work for you this week? I'll confirm the most suitable slot and send over a calendar invite.

Looking forward to speaking with you.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Business Name]
