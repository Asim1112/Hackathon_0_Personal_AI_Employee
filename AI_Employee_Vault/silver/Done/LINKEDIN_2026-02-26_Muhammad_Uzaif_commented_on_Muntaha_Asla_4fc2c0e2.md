## Processing Notes

**Skill:** SKILL_Gmail_Triage → LinkedIn branch
**Classification:** 🟢 LOG_ONLY
**Reasoning:** Duplicate capture — same Muhammad Uzaif comment on Muntaha Aslam's post ("Pehle treat then reach 😁"), previously processed under a different hash. LinkedIn watcher captured it again with a new ID. Social noise, not directed at this account, no business relevance. No HITL triggered.
**Note:** Deduplication SHA-256 hash differs from previous capture — watcher picked up a second scrape of the same notification. No action needed beyond archiving.
**Action taken:** Logged and archived. No draft. No HITL.
**Processed by:** SKILL_Gmail_Triage at 2026-02-27T00:10:00Z
