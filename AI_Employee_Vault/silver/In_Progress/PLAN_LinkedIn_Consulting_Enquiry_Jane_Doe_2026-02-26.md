# Plan: LinkedIn Consulting Enquiry — Jane Doe

**Goal:** Handle inbound consulting enquiry from Jane Doe on LinkedIn. Draft a warm reply for human review, and produce a LinkedIn post capitalising on the business opportunity signal.

**Contact:** Jane Doe (NEW contact — not in Key Contacts)
**Source:** LinkedIn messaging
**Priority:** HIGH — active business opportunity

## Steps

- [x] Step 1: Read and classify the LinkedIn notification (business_opportunity, HIGH)
- [x] Step 2: Identify Jane Doe as a new contact → HITL required for any DM reply
- [x] Step 3: Write DM reply draft → `Pending_Approval/NEW_CONTACT_REVIEW_Jane_Doe_DM_2026-02-26.md`
- [x] Step 4: Run SKILL_LinkedIn_Draft → write LinkedIn post → `Pending_Approval/LINKEDIN_DRAFT_Consulting_Services_2026-02-26.md`
- [ ] Step 5: Human approves DM reply → reply sent manually via LinkedIn
- [ ] Step 6: Human approves LinkedIn post → linkedin-mcp posts to feed
- [ ] Step 7: Log outcome to Dashboard.md and move source file to Done/

---

## Notes

- HITL triggers: #2 (new contact DM) and #3 (any LinkedIn post)
- Do NOT reply to Jane Doe or post until human approves both files
- If Jane Doe becomes a client, add to Company_Handbook.md Section 11
- Opportunity value: consulting enquiry — treat as P2 HIGH until qualified
