## Claude's Assessment

- **Intent:** Genuine consulting enquiry — warm, specific, professional tone
- **Opportunity level:** HIGH — mentions "a project" and requests a call
- **Recommended response:** Warm acknowledgement + availability offer
- **Risk:** Low — no financial commitment, no sensitive data shared
- **Next step if approved:** qualify the opportunity on the call
