# SKILL: LinkedIn Draft (Silver Tier)

## What This Skill Does

Auto-drafts professional LinkedIn sales/promotional posts based on business events,
opportunities, or manual prompts. Every draft is written to `Pending_Approval/` and
requires human approval before the LinkedIn MCP posts it.

**Core principle:** Claude drafts, human approves, LinkedIn MCP posts.

---

## When to Run This Skill

Run this skill when:
- A `type: linkedin_opportunity` file appears in `Needs_Action/`
- The user says "draft a LinkedIn post about X"
- A business milestone, new service, or client win warrants promotion
- The daily 8 AM briefing identifies a promotional opportunity

---

## Pre-Conditions (check before starting)

- [ ] Read `Company_Handbook.md` Section 12 (LinkedIn Content Strategy) in full
- [ ] Check the LinkedIn Queue in `Dashboard.md` — max 1 post per day in queue
- [ ] Verify the topic is NOT on the prohibited list (client names, financials, complaints)
- [ ] Read Company_Handbook.md Section 4 (HITL) — all LinkedIn posts require approval

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Identify the post topic

From the trigger (queue file or manual request), extract:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Topic / event | Body of `linkedin_opportunity` file, or user's instruction |
| Post type | Match to Section 12 table (success story / service announcement / thought leadership / celebration) |
| Key message | What value does this deliver to the LinkedIn audience? |
| Call to action | What should readers do? (DM, comment, visit website, etc.) |

If the topic is on the **prohibited list** (client names, financials, legal, complaint-related):
- Do NOT draft a post
- Write a `Pending_Approval/LINKEDIN_BLOCKED_<slug>_<date>.md` explaining why
- Flag in Dashboard and stop

---

### Step 2 — Check posting frequency

Check `Dashboard.md` LinkedIn Queue:
- If there is already 1 post scheduled for today → queue this for tomorrow
- If there are already 3 posts this week → flag to human, do not queue
- Maximum: 3 posts per week, 1 per day

---

### Step 3 — Draft the post

Follow the post structure from Company_Handbook.md Section 12:

```
[HOOK — one bold opening line that earns the scroll-stop]

[PROBLEM or CONTEXT — 2-3 sentences]

[SOLUTION or INSIGHT — 2-3 sentences about your approach]

[RESULT or CALL TO ACTION — what the reader should do next]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

**Writing rules:**
- Length: 150–300 words
- Tone: Professional, confident, value-led — not salesy or clickbaity
- First person: "We", "I", "Our team"
- No client names without explicit permission
- No financial figures (revenue, invoice amounts, exact prices)
- No confidential project details
- 3–5 hashtags, mix of broad (#Business) and specific (#AIEmployee)
- Optional: 1 relevant emoji per paragraph maximum

---

### Step 4 — Write draft to Pending_Approval/

**Filename:** `LINKEDIN_DRAFT_<topic-slug>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`

**Format:**

```markdown
---
type: linkedin_draft
topic: "<short topic description>"
post_type: <success_story | service_announcement | thought_leadership | celebration>
created: 2026-02-25T10:00:00Z
scheduled_for: <YYYY-MM-DD or "ASAP">
status: pending
approved: false
send_via_mcp: linkedin-mcp
character_count: <approx count>
hashtags:
  - "#Hashtag1"

- [ ] No client names (unless they have given explicit written consent)
- [ ] No financial figures (revenue, invoice amounts, salary, profit)
- [ ] No confidential project details or proprietary methodology
- [ ] No negative sentiment (complaints, disputes, competitor criticism)
- [ ] No unverified claims (awards, statistics without sources)
- [ ] No promises of specific outcomes to readers

## Post Type Examples

### Success Story (anonymised)
```
We just wrapped a 3-month project that transformed how a professional services firm manages their data.

The challenge: 40% of staff time was going into manual data reconciliation.
Our solution: A bespoke automation layer that reduced that to under 5%.

The result? A team that now focuses on strategy, not spreadsheets.

If you're still wrestling with the same problem, let's talk.

### Service Announcement
```
Excited to announce we're now offering AI Employee setup for small businesses.

Most owners spend 15+ hours a week on tasks that could be handled automatically — email triage, invoice chasing, scheduling.

We've built a system that handles all of it, with human oversight built in at every step.
