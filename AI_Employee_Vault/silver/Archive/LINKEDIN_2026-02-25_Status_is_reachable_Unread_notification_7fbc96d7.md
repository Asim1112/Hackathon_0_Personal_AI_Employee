## Notification Content

Status is reachable

Unread notification.

Sania Naeem posted: I’ve been strengthening my core foundations by writing important technical concepts in my notebook and studying them in depth for better clarity and understanding. The topics I explored include FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Native architecture, Databases, AI-Native Software Development, Prompt Engineering, Agentic AI, Claude, OpenAI Agent Kit, and Speckit. Instead of just watching tutorials or reading articles, I prefer documenting concepts in my own words. Writing helps me slow down, connect ideas, and truly understand how backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and AI-driven architectures work together. Building intelligent systems requires strong fundamentals. I’m focusing on depth, consistency, and continuous growth.. one concept at a time.
