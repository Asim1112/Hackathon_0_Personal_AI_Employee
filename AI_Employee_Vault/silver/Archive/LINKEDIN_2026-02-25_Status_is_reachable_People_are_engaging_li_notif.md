## Notification Content

Status is reachable
People are engaging with Areesha Kainat’s post: I didn’t expect two certificates to feel this personal. But they do. A few months ago, “𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗔𝗜” sounded complicated. Prompt engineering felt like just typing better questions. Turns out… it’s way deeper than that. Late nights. Rewatching lectures. Fixing small mistakes again and again. Questioning myself before exams. And today? 𝟴𝟰% in 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗔𝗜 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹-𝟭. 𝟵𝟮% in 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 & 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴. Alhamdulillah. Not posting this to show scores. Posting this because growth feels different when you actually struggle for it. And if you’re learning AI rn you know it’s not just about tools. It’s about thinking differently. Small step. Big motivation boost. On to the next level PIAIC | Muhammad Qasim | Zia Khan #AI #AgenticAI #PIAIC #LearningJourney #TechPakistan
